# üìò DIA - Logic Runner Index ‚Äì July 31, 2025

**Seal ID:** `DIA10-072325-GDI`  
**Author:** Grounded DI  

## üß† What This Is

This repository contains logic runners built under the DIA (Deterministic Intelligence Architecture) system.

All logic runners are scroll-sealed, entropy-locked, and structured for deterministic execution.  
They are designed to operate **without drift**, **near-zero hallucination**, and with **reproducible logic-bound outputs** across legal, medical, governance, engineering, and risk domains
