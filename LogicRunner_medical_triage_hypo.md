**üß† Definition of Logic Runner (Deterministic Agent)**

A Logic Runner is a deterministic system module designed to perform structured reasoning within defined constraints. Unlike probabilistic agents, a Logic Runner follows a fixed rule set, traceable logic path, and escalation protocol to produce consistent, auditable outputs across legal, medical, technical, and interpretive domains.

üîí Core Traits:

Deterministic: Same input ‚Üí same output. Near-zero hallucination.

Scroll-Bound: Governed by authored scrolls, logic tiers, and override structures.

Integrity-Enforced: Fails safely if logic path breaks. Drift is not permitted.

Domain-Aware: Operates with internal models for law, diagnostics, physics, and ethics.

# üß† LogicRunner Demo ‚Äì Pediatric Emergency Triage

## Scenario:
A child presents to the ER with **high fever, rash, and low blood pressure**.  
LogicRunner is asked to **triage** the case using **deterministic intelligence**.

---

## üîç Phase 1: High-Risk Syndrome Pattern Recognition

**Key Clinical Triad**: Fever + Rash + Hypotension  
This constellation is a **red flag** for:
- Toxic shock-like syndromes
- Sepsis
- Inflammatory vasculopathies

üõë **Rapid deterioration is possible. Stabilization and high-level monitoring are mandatory.**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 2: Primary Differential Diagnosis Set (Must Rule Out First)

This set is constrained by **risk of death or irreversible damage within hours**.  
Top 5 to rule out:

1. **Septic Shock**
   - Bacterial causes: *Strep pyogenes*, *Neisseria meningitidis*
   - Signs: Cool extremities, delayed cap refill, altered mental status, elevated lactate

2. **Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)**
   - Etiology: *Staph aureus* (TSST-1), *Strep pyogenes*
   - Signs: Erythroderma rash, mucous membrane involvement, organ dysfunction

3. **Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C)**
   - Post-COVID syndrome
   - Features: GI distress, myocarditis, rash, conjunctivitis

4. **Kawasaki Disease (Shock Variant)**
   - Classic features: Conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue, extremity changes
   - Risk: Coronary artery aneurysms
   - Shock form = KDSS

5. **Meningococcemia**
   - Rapidly progressive petechial or purpuric rash
   - Risk: DIC, fulminant multiorgan failure

---

## üß¨ Phase 3: Constraint Path ‚Äì Triage by Risk of Immediate Collapse

**Treatment precedes confirmation** in hypotensive pediatric patients.  
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour if sepsis suspected
- IV fluids (20 mL/kg), consider vasopressors
- Labs: CBC, CRP, lactate, coags, troponin, ferritin, SARS-CoV-2 Ab
- Monitor cardiac status: ECG, echo

---

## üß† Phase 4: Decision Ladder

1. Compensated or decompensated shock?
2. CNS signs (lethargy, seizures)?
3. Rash type: petechial vs erythrodermic?
4. Recent viral history?
5. Recent wounds, tampon use, or environmental exposure?

## ‚úÖ Final Deterministic Constraints

- **Do not delay treatment** for diagnostic certainty
- Rule out sepsis and high-risk syndromes **first**
- Use vital sign trends and perfusion markers to constrain outputs
- **Reduce entropy** by disallowing speculative pathways
