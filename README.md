# DI-LogicRunner
A Logic Runner is a deterministic system module (agent) designed to perform structured reasoning within defined constraints. Unlike probabilistic agents, a Logic Runner follows a fixed rule set, traceable logic path, and escalation protocol to produce consistent, auditable outputs across legal, medical, technical, and interpretive domains. Powered by Grounded DI. Patent-Pending.
